## ⚙️ Project demonstration (demontração do projeto)
The algorithm scraps the public Answer to Advance from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Office website, and salve them in a CSV file.

On this project, using BeautifulSoup (BS) or Selenium packages, I developed four different scripts to scrap, so I would be able to compare their efficiency.
The options available are:

<p align="center"> <img alt="options_of_scraping.JPG" title="options_of_scraping.JPG" src="./assets/options_of_scraping.JPG" width="500px">

The result is interesting:
* Running BS scraping row by row is more efficient than using BS scraping column by column;
* Both are more efficient than using Selenium. In this case, running Selenium to scrap row by row is more efficient than using Selenium to scrap column by column.

The runnig time for each option is shown bellow:

- time_running_BS_by_row:  0:00:00.033499
- time_running_BS_by_column:  0:00:00.059463
- time_running_selenium_by_row:  0:00:49.721204
- time_running_selenium_by_column:  0:00:53.147911

Finally, an example of data scraped can be seen here: [rfb_data.csv](./rfb_data.csv)
